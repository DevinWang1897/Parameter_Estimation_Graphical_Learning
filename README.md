# Parameter_Estimation_Graphical_Learning
Distribution line parameter (impedance) estimation with physics-informed graphical learning method.

# Overview
This project performs distribution line parameter (impedance) estimation with a physics-informed graphical learning method. The input and output are as follows:
Input of the model: initial inaccurate line parameters, distribution network topology, measurement data of smart meters, SCADA and PMU (if there are).
Output of the model: the estimated parameter estimation results.

# How to Use
## Before using the code, a user should perepare all the needed input data and variables. These data and variables are saved in a file containing a matlab structure called "Input_struct".
